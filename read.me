# Pokémon Trainer Messenger (JavaScript)

## 📌 Project Description

In this project, I implemented a **Pokémon-themed chat system** that allows trainers to communicate with each other in real time or near real time.

The application provides a **real chat system** where users (trainers) can:
- Select another trainer from a **dropdown list**
- Send messages directly to the selected trainer
- Store all messages in a **database**
- Retrieve messages when chatting with a specific trainer

This project focuses on **client–server communication**, **database interaction**, and **user-to-user messaging logic**.
